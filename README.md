# Startpage-v2
The new iteration of my startpage. With every new startpage, my goal is to learn something new.
The last time it was basic HTML/CSS, now it was a bit more thorough, including:

- [x] Valid HTML
- [x] Customization with complex JavaScript behind it
- [x] Pure Javascript, no jQuery at all
- [ ] Easy to understand *Working on it... * ðŸ™„

If you would like to use this you have a few options.

1. **Easiest** Set your homepage to https://dubbie.github.io/startpage-v2/.
2. You can simply clone this repo's master branch.
3. Download the latest from [releases](https://github.com/Dubbie/startpage-v2/releases).
